# Yelp Recruiting Competition

## question description
How many "useful" votes will a Yelp review receive? Show off your skills to land an interview for a position on a Yelp data mining team!

Here at Yelp, we really love the quality of our data. We're grateful that so many of our users take the time to write such great reviews. We track 3 community-powered metrics of review quality: **Useful, Funny, Cool**. Over time, a good review will accumulate lots of votes in these categories from the community. However, another extremely important quality feature is the **freshness** of a review. What if we didn't have to wait for the community to vote on the best reviews to know which ones are high quality?

The goal of this competition is to estimate **the number of Useful votes** a review will receive. Yelp isn't only looking for the answer to this question; we're looking for an engineer that can solve this problem and push their code to production. The prize is a fast track through the recruiting process -- straight to an interview and the opportunity to show Yelp Engineers just what you've got.
